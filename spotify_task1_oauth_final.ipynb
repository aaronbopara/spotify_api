    "# **Spotify Web API Task 1 : Obtaining an OAuth Token**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Background** ###\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to obtaining an OAuth token from the Spotify Web API. An OAuth token is necessary to authenticate requests and access specific data on Spotify, such as creating and modifying playlists on your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Prerequisites**\n",
    "Before proceeding, you need to set up a Spotify Developer App and obtain the following details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Client ID**: Your application's unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Client Secret**: A secret key for your application, used to authenticate your requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Redirect URI**: A URL to which Spotify will redirect after user authorization. This must be registered in your Spotify Developer Dashboard.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These credentials can be found on your app's dashboard on the Spotify Developer Portal. Make sure to never hardcode your client ID and client secret directly in your scripts due to security risks. Instead, store them securely, such as in an environment file (.env), and load them into your program as needed.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **User Authentication**\n",
    "To obtain an OAuth token, you will need to log in to your Spotify account and grant permission for the app to access your data. This is required to authenticate and authorize your requests. The program will ask for the following... \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Username or email address :** The users Spotify username or email address \n",
    "- **User ID :** The users Spotify User ID, this can be found by checking your profile URI on the Spotify Web Application. \n",
    "- **Password :** The users Spotify password \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scope of Access**\n",
    "The OAuth token you obtain through this process will allow your application to create and modify playlists on your Spotify account. Depending on the permissions (scopes) you request, you may have access to additional features. Make sure to review and request only the scopes your application needs.For this request our scope is 'playlist-modify-private playlist-modify-public' as we want to use this token in the next task, where we will be creating a playlist and appending songs to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step by Step Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step by step guide to the process :\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Import Libraries :** Importing the relevant libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Import Secrets :** Initialise the .env file and retrieve sensitive information from within.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Make HTTP Headers :** Set up the Spotify Authorisation Header Credentials \n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Selenium to Automate Log In :** Set up browser environment, open Spotify Authorisation page, and ask user to input log in details. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Parse Response for Authorisation Code :** Obtain and parse through response URL to obtain authorisation code.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) **Exchange Authorisation Code :** Access the Spotify Web API, make a POST request and obtain JSON response. \n",
    "\n",
    "8) **Obtain OAuth and Refresh Tokens :** Parsing through JSON response to obtain tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "9) **Export Tokens to ENV File :** Export the tokens to .env file \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will have a clear understanding of how to obtain an OAuth token to the Spotify Web API"
