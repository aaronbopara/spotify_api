    "# **Spotify Web API Task 3 : Obtaining an Artists Top Tracks**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Background** ###\n",
    "This notebook provides a step by step guide to obtaining a given artists top tracks on Spotify. We will access the Spotify Web API in order to do so. The program will ask the user to input the name of an artist and will return a list of their top ten tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Prerequisites**\n",
    "Before proceeding, you need to set up a Spotify Developer App and obtain the following details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Client ID**: Your application's unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Client Secret** : A secret key for your application, used to authenticate your requests.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "These credentials can be found on your app's dashboard on the Spotify Developer Portal. Make sure to never hardcode your client ID and client secret directly in your scripts due to security risks. Instead, store them securely, such as in an environment file (.env), and load them into your program as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step by Step Guide**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step by step guide to the process : \n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Import Libraries :** Importing the relevant libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Import Secrets :** Initialise the .env file and retrieve sensitive information from within.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Make Function to Obtain Access Token :** Gain access token from the Spotify Web API \n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Make Function to Make HTTP Headers :** Make headers to use during the Authorisation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Make Function Which Searches for the Artist :** This will gather information on the specified artist and retrieve their name and artist id.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) **Make Function to Search for the Artists Songs :** This will retrieve the specified artists top tracks on Spotify.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) **Make a Composite Function :** This will combine all functions into one function which can be called all at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "8) **Test Program :** This will test the program and obtain the band SAULT's top tracks."
